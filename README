Analog-to-digital converter (voltmeter) from USART

1.Multi-channel voltmeter:
The device measure the voltage in the range of 0-1V with the precision of 1 mV from different sources (4 channels ADC input: ADC7, ADC6, ADC5, ADC4).
Measurements carry with a period of 1 ms with averages of 16 measurements.
Result display on a 7 segment displays.
When the corresponding channel is switched on, the LED corresponding to this channel is illuminating too.

The first button is the cyclic mode of switch the input channels of the ADC.
The second button is the automatic mode of switch the input channels of the ADC with period 1s.

2. USART:
Control device is possible from the a computer.
From a computer there is a possibility to switch the input channel of the ADC and carry out measurements and transmit to the computer.
The data are transmitted to a computer containing the channel number and voltage.


The code was written in Atmel Studio, a code tested in the program Proteus.
